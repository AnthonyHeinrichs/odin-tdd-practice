I wrote tests for the following list, then wrote the code to make the tests pass!
* A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
* A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
* A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. 
* A caesarCipher function that takes a string and returns it with each character “shifted”.
* An analyzeArray function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
